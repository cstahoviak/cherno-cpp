Notes related to [Jason's Turner's C++ Weekly](https://www.youtube.com/@cppweekly/playlists) YouTube channel.

This "homework" series are not actually recommendations, i.e. it's not a _good idea_ to actually `auto` _all the things_. These homework exercises are more meant to illustrate the limitations of following the advice in the title, i.e. to what extent can I get away with using `auto`? And, more importantly, where am I explicitly restricted from declaring a variable type `auto`? For example, non-static data members of a class cannot not be declared using `auto`.
